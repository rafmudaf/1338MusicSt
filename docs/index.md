# Yes, demo is bad. But why does the City not follow the ruling?
Nearly everyone can agree that a demolition is a sad outcome for a person's
property. That is not the goal, and it should not be celebrated. However,
the central question here is why does the City of NO choose not to follow
through with the ruling of Code Enforcement hearings?
